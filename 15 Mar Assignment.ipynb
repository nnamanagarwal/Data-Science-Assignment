    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by first training a model on a dataset of normal or typical behavior. The model learns to represent the patterns in the normal data, and can then use this representation to identify instances that do not fit the normal pattern, which may be considered anomalies.\n",

    "For example, in a dataset of credit card transactions, the majority of transactions may be normal purchases. An unsupervised learning model can be trained on this data to learn the patterns of normal purchases. Then, when a new transaction occurs, the model can use the learned patterns to determine if the transaction is abnormal or not. If the transaction is significantly different from the learned patterns, it may be flagged as an anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning can also be used in anomaly detection by identifying outliers in the data. In this approach, the model does not learn a representation of normal behavior, but instead identifies data points that are far from the rest of the data in some way. For example, clustering algorithms can group together similar data points, and data points that are far from any cluster may be considered anomalies.\n",
