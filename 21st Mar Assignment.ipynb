    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables where the categories are ordered based on the target variable. This technique is useful when there is a strong relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category of the categorical variable.\n",
    "2. Sort the categories based on the mean value.\n",
    "3. Assign an ordinal value to each category based on the sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example__\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're working on a project to predict house prices, and your dataset contains a feature called \"neighborhood\", which has 10 unique values. You know that the neighborhood in which a house is located can have a significant impact on its price, but you don't want to create 10 new columns using one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you could use target guided ordinal encoding to transform the \"neighborhood\" feature into a numerical format that captures the relationship between the neighborhood and the target variable (i.e., house price). Here's how you could do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the mean house price for each neighborhood.\n",
    "- Sort the neighborhoods in descending order based on their mean house price.\n",
    "- Assign a unique ordinal value to each neighborhood based on its ranking (i.e., the neighborhood with the highest mean house price gets assigned a value of 1, the next highest gets assigned a value of 2, and so on).\n",
    "- Replace the original \"neighborhood\" values with their corresponding ordinal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using target guided ordinal encoding, you can capture the relationship between the \"neighborhood\" feature and the target variable in a single numerical column, rather than creating multiple columns using one-hot encoding. This can help to reduce the dimensionality of your dataset and improve the performance of your machine learning models."
